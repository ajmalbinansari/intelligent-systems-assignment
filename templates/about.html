                    This application is designed to help identify plant diseases using deep learning technology.
                    It uses a state-of-the-art EfficientNet model trained on the PlantVillage dataset to
                    analyze plant leaf images and detect diseases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model can identify diseases across multiple plant species including tomato, potato,
                    apple, corn, grape, cherry, and more. It provides confidence scores and basic
                    management recommendations.

                            This application was developed as part of a machine learning project focused on sustainable
                            agriculture. The goal is to provide farmers and gardeners with an accessible tool for early
                            disease detection, which can reduce crop losses and minimize the use of pesticides.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The web interface is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, combined
                            with Bootstrap for responsive design. This makes the application accessible on
                            both desktop and mobile devices.
